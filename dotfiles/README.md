## Files included

These files are copied to /home/vagrant, inside the VM.

- .gitconfig: global git config for "vagrant" user, edit before running the provisioner
  to set your name/email or other preferences.
- .vimrc: minimal vim configuration, enabling pathogen + settings for some of
  of the plugins downloaded automatically.
- .zshrc: minimal zsh config file; edit to suit your needs.

Files with "-supercharged" suffix are the ones I use; you may want to use those instead
of the default ones :)
